# RESTFUL API Using Python Flask and Swagger UI

## A Brief Introduction

In last few years REST (REpresentational State Transfer) has been used as an architectural design for web services and web APIs. The REST architecture was originally designed to fit the HTTP protocol that the world wide web uses.
Central to the concept of RESTful web services is the notion of resources. Resources are represented by URIs. The clients send requests to these URIs using the methods defined by the HTTP protocol, and possibly as a result of that the state of the affected resource changes.

Building RESTFUL web services with Flask is quite simple. There are many Flask extensions that help with building RESTful services with Flask. In place of a database we will use a memory structure. it woyld work when the web server that runs our application is single process and single threaded. it is just to be used as example with Flask's own development web server. one must not use this technique on a production web server, proper database either SQL or No-SQL depends on the usage setup must be used instead.

Moreover we have used Swagger UI that allows anyone — be it your development team or your end consumers — to visualize and interact with the API’s resources without having any of the implementation logic in place.

## Pre-requisites

One must have Python installed in his local system for deploying this RESTFUL-API easily. Other than Python one must also have to install Python-Flask and its dependencies as mentioned in the requirements.txt file.

## Running the RESTFUL-API Service

```sudo python run.py``` 

It will deploy the web service, no need of any manual or human intervention.
